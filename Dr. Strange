The **Seven Hour War** is a fictional event in the *Half-Life* universe, taking place between the end of *Half-Life 1* and the start of *Half-Life 2*.

Here’s the gist:

* After the **Resonance Cascade** at Black Mesa (in *Half-Life 1*), portals to alien worlds opened, and Earth’s defenses were already strained fighting hostile alien creatures.
* A vastly more advanced alien empire called the **Combine** noticed Earth’s weakened state and launched a sudden, overwhelming invasion.
* The “war” lasted only about seven hours because the Combine’s technology—striders, gunships, synths, and dimensional control—was far beyond anything Earth could fight back with.
* Cities were devastated, militaries collapsed, and humanity faced total annihilation.
* The war ended when Dr. Wallace Breen, former administrator of Black Mesa, negotiated humanity’s surrender in exchange for his own position as Earth’s administrator under Combine rule.
* This surrender is why Earth in *Half-Life 2* is under tight Combine control, with suppression of reproduction, heavy surveillance, and the transformation of cities into Combine outposts.

If you imagine it, the Seven Hour War was less like a drawn-out battle and more like a blitzkrieg on steroids—except the invaders had spaceships, teleportation, and transdimensional soldiers.
